    * Made changes to the code to compile it with gcc-4.8.
2012-07-03
	* Illumina read name now have spaces in them. The read names are not unique
	  when these spaces are not considered. I modified the assembler.c and the
	  Makefile to handles these new names.
2012-06-08
    * Added a check in sequeces.c to check for empty hits file
2012-04-14
    * Change the genomewelder.c to align 250 bps from the contig ends before
      welding them together.
2012-02-04
    * Added the module "best_hit" which selects one qualifying alignment per
      read based on user specified switch. 
    * Made changes to README to reflect the addition of the module.
2011-09-25
    * Added an option -m/--cov which removes any contigs where the average
      depth of coverage is less than specified by the user.
2011-08-31
    * Changed code in assembler.c to handle ACE files correctly. Some of the
      viewers including Tablet were not working with the previously generated
      ACE files.
2011-08-05
    * The contig names for the assembly and ACE file are now named consistently.
      The format of the names is Contig${index}_${reference}_${start}_${stop},
      where index is just added to make all contig names unique.   
    * Made changes to contig.c to remove a memory leak. 
2011-07-22
    * Added an option -1, which restricts the realignment step to just one
      iteration. This is to speed up the assembly of regions with high coverage.
2011-07-15
    * Added an option -i which implies that the quality values are in Illumina
      format. The default quality values are in Sanger quality format.
2011-07-11
    * First tag. Set for release
