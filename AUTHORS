Most of the code in this package is written by Aakrosh Ratan (ratan@bx.psu.edu).
Some of the functions in charvec.c, seq.c and util.c were written by Scott
Schwartz.  The realigner module was downloaded from
ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/realigner and modified by Aakrosh Ratan to include
support for ACE files and accept larger sequences. Please contact Aakrosh Ratan:
